							<h4>Project One: Tribute Page to Buckminster Fuller</h4>
							<p>For the first project, I constructed a 
								tribute page to Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller, the legendary American architect, 
								systems theorist, futurist, writer, designer, inventor, and philosopher. 
								Fuller is something of a hero of mine, having overcome the odds to be a true visionary 
								whose ideas are still with us today.</p>
							<p>I used Google Fonts to make the headings looks professional and employed Flex Box.  
								I also decided to keep the main section with a white background, because some of the 
								images &#x2013; particularly the Dymaxion car replica and the Dymaxion map projection 
								of the World &#x2013; had white images, and thus would've not have had the same effect 
								if the background colour was not straight white. </p>	 
							<p>Initially, the time and date were at the top, but this did not look quite right, 
								so it put it in the footer section.</p> 
							<p>The links are in blue for accessibility purposes: blue is generally held up as the 
								best colour to have links in, for those who have sight access requirements.</p>

						<div class="cardtext">
							<h4>Project Two: Project Gallery</h4>
							<p>This project gallery is made up of screenshots of each of the six projects that make up the Founders & Coders application. 
								I have used media queries to try and make the cards scale correctly.</p>

						<div class="cardtext">
							<h4>Project Three: Comment Box</h4>
							<p>For the third project, I constructed a 
								Comment Box, which employed the same logic as when Tweeting: only a maximum of 140 characters 
								allowed.</p>
							<p>This meant setting up a system on JavaScript where a constant variable with the number 140 was invoked 
								as comparison when the user started typing in characters. This logic was complicated by the fact that 
								the counter was counting down from 140 to 0 rather than up, as well as having to account for what 
								would happen to the counter if the user backspaced.</p>	 
							<p>I constructed an if else statement to account for if the user had reached the 
								limit of 140 characters, with not only the text highlighted in red, but also the walls 
								via the outline property in CSS, which I had not encountered before.</p> 
							<p>Finally, I also construct a print function, which not only printed out what the user 
								had typed in the text area before hitting Submit, but also forced them to fill in 
								the Name field, which was printed out too.</p>

						<div class="cardtext">
							<h4>Project Four: Fruit Shop</h4>
							<p>For the fourth project, I constructed a Fruit Shop, with each fruit added to a Cart 
								that displayed on a separate page. </p>
							<p>Each fruit item was linked to a specific object in a Products array in the JavaScript, 
								with an inCart element as one the elements in the object that incremented every time.</p>	 
							<p>A function called displayCart printed out the products on the Cart page, 
								generating the items and price, and calculating a basket total.</p>

						<div class="cardtext">
							<h4>Project Five: Website</h4>
							<p>For this website, which contains a portfolio of my work, I wanted bright, 
								welcoming colours, and settled accordingly on yellow as a background colour, 
								rather than the more forbidding black of my 
								<a href="http://www.dominicsimpson.co.uk" target='_blank'>existing website</a> that 
								I've had for the last few years.</p>
							<p>I've also seen other websites use Roboto Mono font successfully, 
								so I employed this as a paragraph font.</p>

						<div class="cardtext">
							<h4>Project Six: Theseus &amp;The Minotaur</h4>
							<p>For my in-depth, based around a more in-depth, complicated piece of work, I used the Greek 
								legend of <a href="https://mythsandlegend.com/theseus-and-the-minotaur/" target='_blank'>Theseus 
								and The Minotaur</a>. 
								I had been thinking for a while about how to represent 
								the Greek legend in a simple game, and how it would work.</p>
							<p>Using an <a href="https://medium.com/codex/build-a-maze-game-with-vanilla-javascript-part-1-of-2-ddfd35e84e93">online template</a>, 
								I jotted down some pseudocode and constructed two identical maze levels to represent 
								the Labyrinth after experimenting first with wireframes on Google Sheets. 
								The two levels were there in order to have one Theseus sprite for each. 
								Each Theseus sprite traverses the Labyrinth, via the user's use of keyboard or 
								onscreen buttons, in order to reach the Minotaur at the very centre of the Labyrinth, 
								who Theseus slays. My idea, which I managed to realise after extensive work 
								redesigning the original template, was that the two Theseuses would then be 
								compared to see who reached the Minotaur the quickest. 
								An on-screen statement would state the winner.</p>
							<p>The project was complex to realise and took much redesign of coding. I constructed a Game prototype object, 
								something that I wasn't aware of before, which contained all subsequent functions. 
								These included a Start button and Timer, so that each Theseus could be timed. 
								An additional consideration had to be made on each Theseus having an equidistant route to the Minotaur, 
								which influenced the mirrored pattern of the Labyrinth. The process of transforming from 
								the first level to the second was complex, particularly when trying to restart the timer.</p>

							<h4>Solar System</h4>
							<p>The image above links to a page on my website where I have constructed some animation based on 
								the solar system. This includes all of the planets and some of the main moons.
								I have used CSS animations to do so, including setting the timing duration at different
								levels for each planet, so that they rotate around the animated Sun at different speeds.</p>

							<h4>Web Development work during Birkbeck course</h4>
							<p>I completed a Certificate in Continuing Education in Web Developement at Birkbeck College a few years
								ago, comprising several modules that gave me a good grounding in advanced HTML and basic object-orientated
								programming concepts and logic. This work collects some of the coursework that I completed for these modules.

						<div class="cardtext">
							<h4>Array test</h4>
							<p>This was a previous prompt by Founders &amp; Coders as part of the application process, 
								which involved having a form that prompted the user to enter a sequence of numbers divided
								by commas. If the user clicked on the Filter button and then clicked Submit, the form would
								then state which of those buttons were divisible by two.</p>
							<p>By contrast, if the user clicked on the Reduce function and then clicked Submit, the form would
								then state the total of the numbers inputted.
