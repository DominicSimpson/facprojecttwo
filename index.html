				<h2>Hello!</h2>
				<p>My name is Dominic Simpson and this is my application website for Founders &amp;
					Coders' Skills Bootcamp.</p>
				<p>I grew up not far from Founders &amp;Coders' offices, and have been learning coding on and off
					for the last ten years. I genuinely enjoy designing websites and learning coding, and am ambitious
					to be a full-time software developer. I have enjoyed my experience working with other applicants
					during F&amp;C's meet-ups, both online and in person, and want to take my experience further
					by enrolling on F&amp;C's Skills Bootcamp, with a view to completing a Software Apprenticeship
					at the end, for which I am fully comitted. I am ambitous to be a Software Developer
					full-time. But more than that, I am also able to work as spart of a student community, and apply
					non-judgemental respect and empathy to fellow cohorts.</p>
					<p>My love of coding comes from the creativity and experience of continually learning.
					When I was a kid, I programmed simple computer games on an Amstrad CPC-46, using BASIC language -
					so with the Theseus &amp; Project, it feels like I've come full circle.</p>
					<p>This portfolio contains my work on the six projects that are 
					required as part of the application process, as well as some of my other work. Click twice on each
					Show Description button for an explanation of each project, including a link to 
					the project's GitHub repository.</p>

					<p>For the first project, I constructed a 
						tribute page to Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller, the legendary American architect, 
						systems theorist, futurist, writer, designer, inventor, and philosopher. 
						Fuller is something of a hero of mine, having overcome the odds to be a true visionary 
						whose ideas are still with us today.</p>
					<p>I used Google Fonts to make the headings looks professional and employed Flex Box.  
						I also decided to keep the main section with a white background, because some of the 
						images &#x2013; particularly the Dymaxion car replica and the Dymaxion map projection 
						of the World &#x2013; had white edges, and they blended well with each other. 
						There would've been a jarring effect if there had been a physical image border.</p>	 
					<p>Initially, the time and date were at the top, but this did not look quite right, 
						so it put it in the footer section.</p> 
					<p>The links are in blue for accessibility purposes: blue is generally held up as the 
						best colour to have links in, for those who have sight access requirements.</p>

					<p>This project gallery is made up of screenshot cards of each of the six projects that make up the Founders & Coders application. 
						I have used media queries to try and make the cards scale correctly, and 
						at a max-width of 600px, the images stap on top of each other.</p>

				<div class="cardtext" id="cardThirdText">
					<p>For the third project, I constructed a 
						Comment Box, which employed the same logic as when Tweeting: only a maximum of 140 characters 
						allowed.</p>
					<p>This meant setting up a system on JavaScript where a constant variable with the number 140 was invoked 
						as comparison when the user started typing in characters. This logic was tricky to comprehend at first 
						given that the counter was counting down from 140 to 0 rather than up, as well as having to account 
						for what would happen to the counter if the user backspaced.</p>	 
					<p>I constructed an if else statement to account for if the user had reached the 
						limit of 140 characters, with not only the text highlighted in red, but also the walls 
						via the outline property in CSS, which I had not encountered before.</p> 
					<p>Finally, I also construct a print function, which not only printed out what the user 
						had typed in the text area before hitting Submit, but also forced them to fill in 
						the Name field, which was printed out too.</p>

							<p>For the fourth project, I constructed a Fruit Shop, with each fruit added to a Cart 
								that displayed on a separate page. </p>
							<p>Each fruit item was linked to a specific object in a Products array in the JavaScript, 
								with an inCart element as one the elements in the object that incremented every time.</p>	 
							<p>A function called displayCart printed out the products on the Cart page, 
								generating the items and price, and calculating a basket total.</p>

							<p>For this website, which contains a portfolio of my work, I wanted bright,

								<a href="http://www.dominicsimpson.co.uk" target='_blank'>existing website</a> that 
								I've had for the last few years.</p>
							<p>I've also seen other websites use Roboto Mono font successfully, 
								so I employed this as a paragraph font.</p>

						<div class="cardtext" id="cardSixthText">
							<p>For my in-depth, based around a more in-depth, complicated piece of work, I used the Greek 
								legend of <a href="https://mythsandlegend.com/theseus-and-the-minotaur/" target='_blank'>Theseus 
								and The Minotaur</a>. 
								I had been thinking for a while about how to represent 
								the Greek legend in a simple game, and how it would work.</p>
							<p>Using an <a href="https://medium.com/codex/build-a-maze-game-with-vanilla-javascript-part-1-of-2-ddfd35e84e93" target='_blank'>online template</a>, 
								I jotted down some pseudocode and constructed two identical maze levels to represent 
								the Labyrinth after experimenting first with wireframes on Google Sheets. 
								The two levels were there in order to have one Theseus sprite for each. 
								Each Theseus sprite traverses the Labyrinth, via the user's use of keyboard or 
								onscreen buttons, in order to reach the Minotaur at the very centre of the Labyrinth, 
								who Theseus slays. My idea, which I managed to realise after extensive work 
								redesigning the original template, was that the two Theseuses would then be 
								compared to see who reached the Minotaur the quickest. 
								An on-screen statement would state the winner.</p>
							<p>The project was complex to realise and took much redesign of coding. I constructed a Game prototype object, 
								something that I wasn't aware of before, which contained all subsequent functions. 
								These included a Start button and Timer, so that each Theseus could be timed. 
								An additional consideration had to be made on each Theseus having an equidistant route to the Minotaur, 
								which influenced the mirrored pattern of the Labyrinth. The process of transforming from 
								the first level to the second was complex, particularly when trying to restart the timer.</p>
