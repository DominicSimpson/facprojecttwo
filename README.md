# facprojectfive and #facprojecttwo - Application Website and Project Gallery
###### For my application website and project gallery, which together took up projects two and five as part of my application for Founders & Coders, I decided to use bright, welcoming colours, utilising yellow as the background colour, rather than the more [forbidding black](http://www.dominicsimpson.co.uk) that appears on my own website. I constructed an image carousel and dot buttons that showed visually the projects required to apply. For the paragraph font, I used Roboto Mono font, having seen this used on so many websites successfully. 
###### As requested, I linked in the Project Gallery cards of the following, which were accompanied by a 'Show Description' button that revealed information about each project.*
## List of Projects
1. Tribute Page to Buckminster Fuller
2. Project Gallery (as part of No5 Application Website)
3. Comment Box
4. Fruit Shop Shopping Page
5. Application Website
6. Feature - Theseus & The Minotaur
###### In addition, I also included cards for other coding projects that I have worked on:
1. [Solar System animation](http://www.dominicsimpson.co.uk/animation.html) from my website
2. Portfolio of work from a number of modules in Web Development that I completed at Birkbeck College, central London
3. A previous prompt from Founders & Coders as part of an application for their coding Bootcamp, now discontinued, involving having a form that prompted the user to enter a sequence of numbers divided by commas. If the user clicked on the Filter button and then clicked Submit, the form would then state which of those buttons were divisible by two. By contrast, if the user clicked on the Reduce function and then clicked Submit, the form would then state the total of the numbers inputted.
4. A page on my website with photography by me.

###### * The process of the user clicking the 'Show Description' button to reveal more information about each project is somewhat cumbersome: the user has to click twice to reveal the text, rather than just one time. This may be due to the coding; I am hoping to find a more seamless method.
